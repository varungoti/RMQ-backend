# createHybridResponse API Fix

## Issue Summary

There was an issue with the `createHybridResponse` function call in the `assessment.controller.ts` where an object was being passed as the third parameter instead of a boolean value.

**Problem**: Passing `{ correct: result.isCorrect }` as the third parameter added an unwanted `correct` property to the response.

This was causing issues with tests that expected the response to follow a specific format without the `correct` property.

## Fix Implemented

The issue was resolved by changing:

```typescript
// INCORRECT (before)
createHybridResponse(result, message, { correct: result.isCorrect })

// CORRECT (after)
createHybridResponse(result, message, result.isCorrect)
```

## How `createHybridResponse` Works

The `createHybridResponse` function has the following signature:

```typescript
function createHybridResponse<T>(data: T | null, message: string, successOrProps: boolean | object): any
```

The third parameter can be either:
1. A boolean - Sets the `success` property without adding any additional properties
2. An object - Spreads all properties from the object into the response

When we passed `{ correct: result.isCorrect }` as the third parameter, it was adding the `correct` property to the response. The tests were expecting only the `success` property to be set.

## Verification Testing

Two verification scripts were created to test both implementations:

1. `server/test/verify-controller-fix.js` - Tested the original and fixed controller implementations
2. `server/test/verify-new-hybrid-response.js` - Tested the improved createHybridResponse function

The scripts confirmed:

1. INCORRECT implementation (using object):
   - Response includes a `correct` property
   - `success` is set to `true`

2. CORRECT implementation (using boolean):
   - Response does NOT include a `correct` property 
   - `success` is set to `true`

## Related Tests

This fix resolves issues with the end-to-end tests in:
- `server/test/assessment.e2e-spec.ts`

The tests were failing because they expected a particular response format that didn't include the `correct` property.

## Future Prevention

We took several steps to prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Fixed the controller implementation to pass `result.isCorrect` (boolean) instead of `{ correct: result.isCorrect }` (object)
2. Updated the `createHybridResponse` function with more detailed JSDoc documentation and examples
3. Added warnings about incorrect usage in the function documentation
4. Created test scripts that verify the correct behavior
5. Added documentation explaining the proper use of the function
6. Created a custom ESLint rule to catch incorrect usage patterns
7. Added automated scripts to check for incorrect usage

### ESLint Rule

A custom ESLint rule (`no-incorrect-hybrid-response`) was created to detect incorrect usage patterns. The rule checks for calls to `createHybridResponse` where the third parameter is an object containing a `correct` property.

You can find the rule implementation in:
- `src/eslint-rules/no-incorrect-hybrid-response.js`

Tests for the rule are in:
- `test/eslint-rules/no-incorrect-hybrid-response.spec.js`

### Automated Checks

We've added automated scripts to verify correct usage throughout the codebase:

1. **NPM Script**: Run `npm run check:hybrid-response` to check the entire codebase for incorrect usage
2. **Pre-commit Hook**: The `precommit` npm script includes the check to prevent commits with incorrect usage
3. **CI/CD Integration**: The script at `scripts/ci-check-hybrid-response.sh` can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

These automated checks will help identify incorrect usage patterns early in the development cycle.

### Best Practices for Using createHybridResponse

When using the `createHybridResponse` function:
- Pass a boolean as the third parameter when you only want to set the `success` property
- Only pass an object when you specifically need to add additional properties to the response
- Avoid passing `{ correct: someValue }` as it adds an unwanted property that may break tests

### Example

```typescript
// CORRECT: Passing a boolean (sets only success property)
createHybridResponse(result, "Operation successful", true);

// INCORRECT: Passing an object (adds unwanted properties)
createHybridResponse(result, "Operation successful", { correct: result.isCorrect });

// ALTERNATIVE: When additional properties are needed
createHybridResponse(result, "Operation successful", { customProp: "value" });
