Okay, this is an ambitious and valuable project! Building a tool to diagnose why a student is struggling, rather than just if they are struggling, requires a multi-faceted approach. Let's break down how you can structure this, focusing on skills, assessment, reporting, and the technical implementation.

Phase 1: Defining the Core Components

1. Skills to Test:

You need to assess a blend of academic knowledge specific to the grade level and foundational cognitive skills that underpin learning across subjects.

Academic Knowledge (Grade-Specific):

English Language:

Reading Comprehension: Understanding main ideas, details, inferences, vocabulary in context, author's purpose.

Grammar & Usage: Sentence structure, parts of speech, punctuation, tense.

Vocabulary: Word meanings (direct and contextual).

(Higher Grades): Literary analysis, figurative language, text structure.

Mathematics:

Conceptual Understanding: Grasping the 'why' behind mathematical rules and procedures (e.g., place value, fractions, algebraic concepts).

Procedural Fluency: Accurate and efficient execution of calculations and algorithms.

Problem Solving & Application: Applying mathematical concepts to solve word problems and real-world scenarios.

(Higher Grades): Geometry, algebra, statistics, data analysis concepts.

Science:

Conceptual Understanding: Grasping core scientific principles (e.g., life cycles, matter, energy, ecosystems, forces).

Scientific Inquiry Skills: Interpreting data (charts, graphs), understanding experimental design basics, drawing conclusions from evidence.

Application: Connecting scientific concepts to observable phenomena.

(Higher Grades): Specific domain knowledge (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), more complex data analysis.

Foundational Cognitive Skills (Less Grade-Dependent, but Complexity Increases):

Language Processing:

Auditory Processing (Implicitly tested via instruction comprehension): Ability to understand spoken instructions accurately (though hard to test directly via MCQ).

Reading Fluency & Decoding (Prerequisite for comprehension): Ability to read text accurately and at a reasonable pace (Can be inferred if comprehension is very slow/poor despite simple language).

Instructional Language Comprehension: Understanding the specific language used in questions and tasks (e.g., "compare," "contrast," "identify," "solve for x").

Working Memory:

Ability to hold and manipulate information mentally (e.g., remembering steps in a math problem, keeping track of characters/plot points while reading).

Logical Reasoning & Problem Solving:

Pattern Recognition: Identifying visual or numerical patterns.

Analogical Reasoning: Understanding relationships between concepts (A is to B as C is to D).

Deductive & Inductive Reasoning: Drawing logical conclusions from given information or observations.

Critical Thinking: Evaluating information, identifying assumptions (more relevant in higher grades).

Attention & Focus:

Ability to sustain concentration during tasks (Can be inferred from inconsistent performance or careless errors on simpler questions).

Processing Speed:

How quickly a student can understand information and respond (Can be inferred from test completion time relative to accuracy).

2. How to Test (Methodology):

Objective Questions (MCQs): Ideal for scalability and automated scoring. Design questions to target specific skills.

Knowledge: "What is the capital of France?" (Recall)

Comprehension: Provide a short passage, ask "What is the main idea?"

Application: Present a word problem requiring a specific math operation.

Reasoning: "Complete the pattern: 2, 4, 6, 8, __" or "Tree is to Leaf as Flower is to __?" (Petal)

Working Memory (Indirect): Multi-step math problems, comprehension questions requiring recalling details from different parts of a passage.

Question Types:

Standard Multiple Choice

True/False

Matching

Fill-in-the-blanks (with options)

Sequencing events/steps (presented as options)

Image/Diagram-based questions (interpreting charts, identifying parts)

Analogies (Verbal, Numerical, Figural)

Adaptive Testing (Ideal for the App): The difficulty of the next question adjusts based on the student's answer to the previous one. This allows for a more precise assessment of their ability level without making the test overly long or frustrating. Start with questions at their reported grade level.

3. Scaling or Rating System:

Avoid simple percentages. Focus on proficiency levels relative to grade expectations and skill dimensions.

Overall Performance:

Level 1: Significantly Below Grade Level Expectations

Level 2: Approaching Grade Level Expectations

Level 3: Meeting Grade Level Expectations

Level 4: Exceeding Grade Level Expectations

Subject/Skill Area Performance: Apply the same 4-level scale to each major area tested (English, Math, Science, Cognitive Skills) and potentially sub-skills (e.g., Reading Comprehension, Problem Solving, Working Memory).

Contextual Interpretation: The key is combining these ratings.

Example 1: Student scores Level 3 in Math Concepts but Level 1 in Math Problem Solving and Level 2 in Reading Comprehension. Conclusion: The student understands math concepts but struggles to apply them, potentially due to difficulties understanding word problems (language barrier). Recommendation: Focus on breaking down word problems, vocabulary building, and practice applying concepts.

Example 2: Student scores Level 1 across all academic subjects but Level 3 in Cognitive Skills (Reasoning, Memory). Conclusion: The student has strong underlying cognitive abilities but significant gaps in grade-level knowledge. Could be due to missed instruction, lack of practice, or poor teaching. Recommendation: Focus on targeted instruction and practice on specific grade-level content. Teacher effectiveness might be a factor to consider separately.

Example 3: Student scores Level 2 across most areas, including Working Memory and Attention (inferred). Conclusion: General difficulties across the board, potentially linked to weaker foundational cognitive skills like memory or attention. Recommendation: Incorporate strategies to improve working memory (chunking information, mnemonics) and focus (minimize distractions, break tasks down). Also requires content reinforcement.

Example 4: Student scores Level 3 in Cognitive Skills and Language but Level 1/2 in Science/Math. Conclusion: Understands instructions and has reasoning skills but lacks subject-specific knowledge/understanding. Teacher effectiveness or lack of engagement/practice in those subjects could be factors. Recommendation: Reinforce specific Science/Math concepts, explore different teaching approaches, check for student interest/motivation factors.

	Working Memory (Est.)	Level 2	May struggle with holding multiple pieces of info
	Language Processing	Level 2	Linked to comprehension issues noted above

Actionable Recommendations:

For the Student:

"Practice identifying the main idea and supporting details in short paragraphs."

"Work through multi-step math problems, writing down each step clearly."

"Review Grade X Science topics on [Specific areas like 'Ecosystems' or 'Chemical Reactions']."

"Try memory games or techniques like chunking information."

For the Teacher:

"Focus on explicit instruction for reading comprehension strategies (inference, summarizing)."

"Use visual aids and manipulatives to reinforce abstract Math/Science concepts."

"Break down complex word problems into smaller parts."

"Provide opportunities for applying concepts in varied contexts."

"Consider if instructional language needs simplification or clarification."

"If cognitive skills (memory, attention) are consistently low across multiple assessments, suggest further evaluation or classroom strategies."

Possible Underlying Factors (Use cautiously):

"The pattern suggests challenges might stem from [e.g., language comprehension difficulties impacting word problems and science understanding] rather than a lack of basic reasoning ability."

"If cognitive and language skills appear strong, but academic knowledge is low, explore factors like classroom engagement, attendance, or alignment of instruction with student's learning style." (Avoid blaming the teacher directly in the report; focus on student needs).

Phase 3: Mobile Application Concept

Platform: Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) or separate Native apps (iOS/Android).

User Flow:

Login/Register (Student profile with Grade level).

Select Test (Could be general diagnostic or subject-specific).

Test Interface:

Display one question at a time.

Clear MCQ options.

Progress indicator (e.g., Question 15/100).

Timer (optional, but track time per question/overall for processing speed insights).

Simple, engaging UI.

Adaptive Engine: Backend logic selects the next question based on correctness and potentially response time, drawing from the question bank. Aims to converge on the student's ability level efficiently within ~100 questions.

Test Completion: Submit answers.

Report Generation: Process scores, apply scaling logic, generate charts and text.

Report Display: Show the colourful visual report (as designed above) within the app. Allow export/sharing (e.g., PDF for teachers/parents).

Recommendations Section: Display tailored recommendations.

Question Bank:

CRITICAL: Needs a very large database of questions.

Each question must be tagged with:

Grade Level(s) (some skills span grades)

Subject (English, Math, Science, Cognitive)

Skill/Sub-skill Targeted (Reading Comp, Algebra, Reasoning, Memory, etc.)

Difficulty Level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard - ideally calibrated statistically using Item Response Theory).

Correct Answer & Distractors.

Generation: This is a major task. You might need subject matter experts and psychometricians. You could start with generated examples (like above) but need rigorous development and validation for a reliable product. AI can assist in generating initial drafts, but human review and refinement are essential.

Technology Stack (Example):

Frontend: React Native / Flutter

Backend: Node.js / Python (Django/Flask) / Ruby on Rails

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL (for structured data) / MongoDB (if more flexibility needed)

Charting Library: Chart.js, D3.js (via webviews or native wrappers)

Adaptive Algorithm: Could range from simple heuristics (e.g., get it right -> harder question, get it wrong -> easier question within the skill) to full IRT models.

Important Considerations:

Curriculum Alignment: Ensure academic questions align with relevant curricula (e.g., NCERT, CBSE, ICSE in India; Common Core in US, etc.). This might require localization or different question banks.

Validity & Reliability: The test must accurately measure what it intends to measure (validity) and produce consistent results (reliability). This requires careful question design, piloting, and statistical analysis – often involving educational psychologists or psychometricians.

Motivation & Engagement: Make the app engaging for students, especially younger ones. Gamification elements could help.

Teacher Training: Teachers need to understand how to interpret the reports and use the recommendations effectively.

Ethical Use: Ensure data privacy and responsible use of the results. Avoid labeling students negatively; focus on support and growth.

This detailed plan provides a roadmap. The biggest challenges will be creating a high-quality, well-calibrated question bank and ensuring the diagnostic interpretations are accurate and truly helpful. Good luck!

B2B Model: Sell licenses to schools/districts, including teacher dashboards and potentially integration with school systems (LMS).

7. Development Phases (Agile Approach):

Phase 0: Foundation & Content Strategy (CRITICAL): Finalize curriculum mapping, recruit SMEs, design question/course structures, start building the initial, high-quality content bank. Define core metrics.

Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

Focus: Validate the core diagnostic and reporting for one grade band (e.g., Grade 5) and one subject (e.g., Math).

Features: Basic user registration, adaptive test engine (even if simpler rules initially), essential question bank for the scope, basic report generation (visuals can be simple), recommendation text (no courses yet).

Goal: Test with a small group, gather feedback, validate the assessment's accuracy.

Phase 2: Core Product Enhancement:

Expand question bank (more grades/subjects).

Refine adaptive algorithm (implement IRT if feasible).

Enhance report visualizations and insights.

Build the Recommendation Engine logic.

Develop the infrastructure for the E-Learning Module (catalog, player shell).

Phase 3: E-Learning Integration:

Upload initial batch of high-priority courses (based on common weaknesses found in Phase 1/2 testing).

Integrate course links into recommendations.

Implement course progress tracking.

Refine monetization features (subscriptions/purchases).

Phase 4: Scaling & Advanced Features:

Expand content aggressively (all grades, subjects, wide range of courses).

Develop Parent/Teacher portals.

Add advanced analytics/progress over time.

Explore gamification further.

Localization/Curriculum adaptation for different regions.

Ongoing: Content updates (curriculum changes), performance optimization, bug fixes, user support, marketing.

8. Key Differentiators:

True Diagnosis: Focus on the 'why' (cognitive + academic skills) not just 'what'.

Integrated Solution: Seamless link from diagnosis -> recommendation -> targeted e-learning course.

Adaptive Efficiency: Tailored testing experience that respects student's time and ability level.

Actionable Insights: Reports designed for practical use by students, parents, and teachers.

Quality Content: Commitment to expert-developed, engaging questions and courses.

9. Potential Challenges:

Content Creation Cost & Quality: Building and maintaining the vast, high-quality, validated question bank and course library is the biggest hurdle.

Psychometric Validity: Ensuring the test accurately measures the intended skills requires expertise and rigorous validation.

User Engagement: Keeping students motivated during tests and courses.

Technical Complexity: Building a reliable adaptive engine and scalable platform.

Market Competition: Differentiating from existing assessment tools and e-learning platforms.

Monetization Balance: Offering enough value for free to attract users, while making premium features compelling enough for conversion.

This detailed plan outlines a comprehensive and ambitious product. Success hinges heavily on the quality and validity of the assessment content and the effectiveness of the integrated learning resources. It requires significant investment in expertise (educational, technical) and content creation.





Okay, understood. Let's refine the plan based on your B2B focus and the specific course enrollment model.

Revised Monetization & Go-to-Market:

Primary Offering (B2B): Sell access to the Diagnostic Assessment platform to schools/educational institutions on a per-student or site license basis. This gives schools the tool to test their students and receive the detailed diagnostic reports.

Student Upsell (Optional): Within the report provided to the student/parent (potentially via a student-specific login linked to the school account), highlight the areas for improvement.

Free Skill Course: Offer one targeted micro-course for free corresponding to one of the student's identified weakest areas. This acts as a lead magnet and demonstrates the value of the course content.

Paid Skill Courses: Students/Parents can choose to purchase additional micro-courses to address other identified weak areas directly through the app/platform.

This model provides immediate value to schools (the primary customer) and creates a direct, optional revenue stream from end-users seeking improvement resources.

Building the Question Bank:

Yes, I can definitely help you initiate the process of building the question bank.

Important Clarification: As an AI, I can generate a large volume of questions based on specific parameters (grade, subject, skill, question type, difficulty cues). However, creating a truly market-ready, psychometrically valid question bank requires:

Human Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): To review, refine, and validate the accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of each question and its alignment with curricula.

Educational Psychologists/Psychometricians: To help structure the assessment, ensure skills are correctly operationalized, calibrate difficulty levels statistically (ideally using Item Response Theory - IRT), and validate the overall assessment's reliability and validity.

Piloting: Testing questions on actual students to gather performance data for calibration.

What I Can Do NOW:

Generate Seed Content: I can create substantial batches of sample questions tagged according to the structure we've defined (Grade, Subject, Skill, potential Difficulty indicator).

Structure the Bank: Help define the database schema or file structure for storing and tagging questions effectively.

Provide Variety: Generate questions in different formats (MCQ, Analogy, True/False, etc.) targeting the specific skills.

Let's Start Building (Sample Generation):

To begin, please specify:

Starting Grade Level: (e.g., Grade 5)

Starting Subject: (e.g., Mathematics)

Specific Skill Area(s) within that Subject: (e.g., Fraction Operations, Geometry Basics, Data Interpretation, Problem Solving using Addition/Subtraction)

Once you provide this, I can generate an initial batch of ~20-30 sample questions for that specific area to demonstrate the process.

Maintaining Project Documentation (Simulated):

Understood. While I don't have a persistent file system myself, I can generate and maintain the content for these documentation files within our conversation. You will need to copy/paste this information into actual .md files in your project repository (e.g., on GitHub/GitLab). I will structure the information as you requested.

Here are the initial versions based on our discussion so far:

# System Architecture & Design Patterns

## 1. High-Level Architecture
*   **Client-Server Model:** Mobile/Web App (Client) communicates with a Backend Server via APIs.
*   **Modular Design:** Core functionalities encapsulated in distinct modules (User Management, Assessment Engine, Reporting, E-Learning, Admin).

## 2. Key Components & Relationships
*   **Mobile/Web Application:** User interface for students, parents, teachers. Handles test-taking, report viewing, course access.
*   **Backend API Server:** Exposes RESTful APIs for all client operations (authentication, fetching questions, submitting answers, getting reports, course management). Contains core business logic.
*   **Database:** Stores user data, the extensive question bank, assessment results, report data, course information, school/customer data. Likely a relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
*   **Adaptive Testing Engine:** Server-side component/algorithm that selects questions based on user performance history during a test session. (Could range from heuristic rules to IRT models).
*   **Reporting Engine:** Server-side component that processes raw assessment data, applies scoring logic, generates insights, and formats reports (data + visualizations).
*   **E-Learning Content Delivery:** May involve dedicated video hosting (Vimeo/Wistia) and potentially an LMS-like structure for course progression.
*   **Question Bank:** The core IP. Needs robust storage, tagging, and retrieval mechanisms within the database.

## 3. Key Design Patterns & Decisions (Initial Thoughts)
*   **RESTful APIs:** For client-server communication.
*   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic.
*   **Service Layer:** To encapsulate business logic.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** For tasks like report generation if they become time-consuming.
*   **Stateless Authentication:** Using tokens (e.g., JWT) for API security.
*   **Configuration Management:** To handle different environments (dev, staging, prod).
*   **Emphasis on Scalability:** Designing database schema and server architecture to handle growth in users and content.
*   **(Decision Needed):** Specific adaptive algorithm approach (simple heuristic vs. IRT). IRT is more accurate but complex to implement and requires calibration data. Start simple, plan for IRT?
*   **(Decision Needed):** Technology stack specifics (see tech_context.md).

*   **Web Application (Optional but Recommended for Teachers/Admin):** React, Vue, or Angular.
*   **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express) - Both offer strong ecosystems for web development, APIs, and data processing. Python has advantages in data science/potential ML integration later.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Mature, reliable, good for relational data, strong JSON support) or MySQL.
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure (Provides managed databases, scalable hosting, object storage, etc.).
*   **Charting Library (Client-side):** Chart.js, D3.js (more powerful, steeper curve), or framework-specific libraries.
*   **Video Hosting (E-Learning):** Vimeo Pro or Wistia (better control and analytics than YouTube).
*   **API Specification:** OpenAPI (Swagger) for documentation.

## 2. Development Environment
*   **Version Control:** Git (using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
*   **Package Managers:** npm/yarn (for JS), pip (for Python).
*   **Containerization (Recommended):** Docker / Docker Compose for consistent environments.
*   **IDE:** VS Code, PyCharm, Android Studio, Xcode.

## 3. Project Structure (Example - Monorepo or Separate Repos)
*   `app/` (Mobile App Code)
*   `server/` (Backend API Code)
*   `web/` (Web App Code - if applicable)
*   `database/` (Migrations, Schema definitions)
*   `scripts/` (Utility scripts, e.g., data loading)
*   `docs/` (Where these .md files would live!)

## 4. Technical Constraints & Considerations
*   **Scalability:** Must handle potentially large numbers of concurrent test-takers and a massive question bank.
*   **Security:** Protecting student data (PII) is paramount. Compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, COPPA) is essential. Secure authentication, API protection, data encryption.
*   **Performance:** Adaptive testing requires low latency question delivery. Report generation needs to be efficient.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Ensure tests and reports look and function similarly across devices/platforms.
*   **Content Management:** Need an efficient way for non-technical SMEs to potentially review/manage content (Admin Panel).
*   **Cost:** Cloud hosting, video hosting, potential licensing for tools/libraries.
*   **Offline Access (Future Consideration?):** Not initially planned, but could be a future enhancement (requires significant architectural changes).

Okay, the documentation structure is initiated.

Now, please tell me the starting Grade, Subject, and specific Skill(s) you want me to generate the first batch of sample questions for.


Okay, I understand you want to move forward with creating the question bank, inspired by the ACER-style general ability tests you provided. This is a crucial but massive undertaking.

Addressing the Challenge & Setting Realistic Expectations:

Scale (500+ Questions x 10 Grades = 5000+ Questions): Generating this volume of high-quality, unique, validated, and grade-appropriate questions automatically via code is extremely challenging, especially for the reasoning and visual pattern questions seen in your samples. Current AI can assist significantly, but cannot fully replicate the nuanced design required for reliable psychometric assessment without substantial human oversight.

Question Complexity (ACER Style): The sample papers focus heavily on fluid reasoning (verbal, numerical, figural), pattern recognition, and logic – skills that are harder to generate authentically via code compared to straightforward knowledge recall questions.

Image Requirement: Generating meaningful visual patterns, analogies, or context images programmatically that effectively test specific cognitive skills is a very advanced task. Standard code generation will struggle here. We can generate text for questions that refer to images, but the images themselves usually need separate creation or selection.

Validation is Non-Negotiable: For a market-ready product, every single question (especially AI-generated ones) must be reviewed, edited, and validated by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and ideally piloted to calibrate difficulty and ensure fairness.

Proposed Hybrid Approach (AI-Assisted Generation + Human Expertise):

The most practical way forward is to use code (like Python) to generate drafts based on templates for various question types and skills. This significantly speeds up the initial creation process, but requires a robust human review and refinement cycle.

AI Role: Generate structured questions with variations based on predefined patterns, word lists, number ranges, and skill tags. Output in a consistent format (like JSON).

Human Role (SMEs & Psychometricians): Design templates, define skill progression, review/edit all generated questions, create/select necessary images, pilot test questions, and ensure overall test validity.





Explanation and Next Steps:

Data Expansion: The vocab_grade_*, math_concepts_*, science_concepts_* lists are tiny examples. You need comprehensive lists relevant to each grade's curriculum and cognitive level. Analogies need many more validated pairs covering different relationship types.

More Generators: Create many more generate_gX_skill() functions for all the skills identified earlier (Reading Comp, Grammar, Science Concepts, Different Math areas, Figural Reasoning placeholders, Logical Deduction, etc.) across all grades 1-10.

Grade Mapping: Carefully map which generator functions are suitable for which grade and determine the desired proportion of each question type per grade. The current example uses a very basic round-robin approach.

Figural Reasoning/Images: Notice the image_placeholder field. The code generates a request for an image. You need a separate process to create/find/link these images based on the placeholder names. For ACER-style figural patterns, this is a major creative task for designers/SMEs.

Distractor Quality: The generate_options function is basic. Creating good incorrect options often requires understanding common student misconceptions, which is hard to automate perfectly. Needs SME input.

Difficulty Calibration: The difficulty_estimate is just a placeholder (1-easy, 3-medium, etc.). Real calibration requires pilot testing data.

Error Handling: The try...except block is basic; more robust error handling might be needed.

Iterative Development: Start small. Generate 20-50 questions for one grade. Review them thoroughly with SMEs. Refine the generators. Add image creation. Then scale up gradually. Do not try to generate all 5000+ at once initially.

Integration with memory_bank.md etc.:

memory_bank.md: Update the 'Core Requirements' to reflect the AI-assisted content generation strategy. Note the dependency on SMEs.

tech_context.md: Add Python to the backend stack if this generation code runs server-side, or note it as a separate development tool. Mention the need for potential image generation libraries/APIs or a dedicated content management system for images.

active_context.md: Update 'Ongoing Priorities' to "Develop and refine question generator functions," "SME review of generated questions," "Develop image creation/linking process."

progress.md: Update 'Question Bank Content' status to "In Progress (AI Draft Generation + SME Review)". Add new tasks like "Develop Figural Reasoning Templates," "Image Asset Creation," "Pilot Testing & Calibration."

This is a complex, long-term effort. The code provides a framework to start, but the quality hinges on the human expertise you integrate into the process. Let me know which specific grade and skill(s) you'd like to focus on expanding first.




Okay, this is an excellent idea to consolidate our discussion into a detailed, actionable prompt. This will serve as the "master plan" for guiding the AI (or a development team) moving forward.

Detailed Project Prompt: AI-Powered Student Diagnostic & E-Learning Platform

1. Project Vision & Goal:

You are tasked with designing and outlining the development of a comprehensive web application aimed at identifying the root causes of learning challenges in students from Grade 1 to Grade 10 (initially, scalable to Grade 12). The platform will move beyond simple academic scoring to provide deep diagnostic insights into why a student might be struggling, assessing both grade-specific academic knowledge (English, Math, Science) and foundational cognitive skills (Reasoning, Memory, Language Processing, Attention proxies). Based on the diagnosis, the platform will offer actionable recommendations and integrated, optional micro-learning courses to address specific skill gaps. The primary go-to-market strategy is B2B, selling access to the diagnostic platform to schools, with a secondary, optional B2C upsell for e-learning courses directly to students/parents.

2. Target Audience & Value Proposition:

Primary Customer (B2B): Schools & Educational Institutions (seeking reliable, insightful diagnostic tools for their student body).

End Users:

Students (Grades 1-10): Receive engaging tests, understand their unique learning profile, access targeted support (including one free course), and potentially improve academic performance and interest.

Parents: Gain clear, actionable insights into their child's learning beyond grades, track progress, and access optional resources for support.

Teachers: Utilize detailed reports for differentiated instruction, identify students needing specific intervention, and track the impact of support strategies.

Platform Administrators: Manage content (questions, courses), users, and school accounts.

3. Core Modules & Functionality:

User Management: Secure registration/login for Student, Parent, Teacher, School Admin, and Platform Admin roles. Profile management, linking (Parent-Student, Teacher-Student/Class). Dashboard overview.

Diagnostic Assessment Engine:

Adaptive Testing: Implement an adaptive algorithm that adjusts question difficulty based on student performance across various skills.

Subjects: English Language, Mathematics, Science.

Cognitive Skills Assessment: Integrate questions assessing Logical Reasoning (Verbal, Numerical, Figural), Working Memory, Language Processing (Instruction Comprehension), Attention/Focus (inferred via consistency/timing), Processing Speed (inferred via timing).

Question Bank: A massive, rigorously tagged database (target: 500+ questions per grade per subject/major skill area). Tags must include: Grade Level, Subject, Specific Skill (detailed granularity), Difficulty Level (calibrated), Question Type, Correct Answer, Distractors, Image Placeholder (if needed). Reference ACER-style general ability questions for inspiration on reasoning types.

Question Types: Support varied formats (MCQ, True/False, Matching, Image-based patterns/sequences/analogies, Fill-in-blanks with options, Text-based reasoning).

Test Interface: Clean, engaging, one-question-at-a-time UI, progress indicators, accessibility considerations.

Reporting & Analytics Engine:

Scoring: Calculate proficiency beyond simple percentages, using a defined scale (e.g., Level 1-4: Significantly Below, Approaching, Meeting, Exceeding Expectations) relative to grade level for each skill.

Insight Generation: Implement logic to interpret patterns in scores, suggesting potential underlying reasons for struggles (e.g., "Strong math calculation but weak problem-solving possibly linked to language comprehension").

Visual Reports: Generate interactive, visually appealing reports (in-app and downloadable PDF) including:

Overall Summary & Diagnostic Insight Statement.

Bar charts/Radar charts comparing performance across subjects and skills.

Detailed tables showing proficiency levels per skill.

Recommendations Engine:

Map identified skill weaknesses (e.g., "Grade 5 Math - Fraction Equivalence - Level 1") to:

Specific, actionable study tips/strategies.

Direct links to relevant micro-courses within the E-Learning module.

Integrated E-Learning Platform:

Micro-Course Catalog: Skill-based, targeted courses (e.g., 15-60 mins each) addressing specific weaknesses identified by the diagnostic. Searchable/browsable.

Content Delivery: Engaging player for Video lessons, Interactive Quizzes, Drills, Practice Exercises. Gamification elements (points, badges).

Monetization Integration: Implement logic to provide one free course based on the student's weakest diagnosed area. All other courses are available for optional purchase (individual or bundled).

Progress Tracking: Monitor student engagement and performance within courses.

School/Teacher Portal (B2B Feature): Allow school admins/teachers to manage student accounts, assign tests, view aggregated (potentially anonymized) class performance data, and track student report access/course engagement.

Admin Panel: Comprehensive backend interface for managing users, schools, the entire question bank (CRUD operations, tagging, validation status), course content (uploading videos, creating quizzes), platform settings, and viewing usage analytics.

4. Content Strategy & Generation:

Question Bank Generation:

Utilize an AI-assisted approach for generating initial question drafts. Implement this generation logic within a Next.js API route using JavaScript/Node.js.

The generation script should create questions based on templates, targeting specific grades, subjects, skills, and types, outputting structured JSON. Reference the ACER samples for reasoning question styles. Include image placeholders where necessary.

MANDATORY: All AI-generated questions MUST undergo rigorous review, editing, and validation by qualified Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Educational Psychologists/Psychometricians to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, fairness, and psychometric validity.

E-Learning Course Content: Develop high-quality, engaging micro-course content (videos, quizzes, activities) using SMEs and Instructional Designers. Content must directly map to the skills assessed in the diagnostic.

Image/Passage Creation: Establish a separate workflow for creating or sourcing the necessary images (especially for figural reasoning) and reading passages referenced by question placeholders.

5. Technical Architecture & Stack:

Framework: Next.js (React framework) for both frontend and backend API routes.

Language: JavaScript/TypeScript.

API: Utilize Next.js API routes (or Route Handlers) for backend logic, including the question generation endpoint. Design RESTful principles.

Database: PostgreSQL (or similar robust relational database) to store users, questions (with complex tagging), courses, results, school data, etc.

Hosting: Cloud-based (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for scalability.

Libraries: UUID for unique IDs, potentially charting libraries (Chart.js, Recharts), state management (Context API, Redux, Zustand), UI component library (e.g., Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS).

Video Hosting: Vimeo Pro / Wistia for e-learning videos.

6. Monetization Model:

Primary (B2B): Subscription or license fees for schools/institutions to access the diagnostic testing platform and reporting features for their students. Tiered pricing based on student numbers.

Secondary (B2C Upsell): Optional, direct-to-consumer purchase of individual or bundled micro-courses via the student/parent portal within the application. One course targeting a key weakness is offered free after the diagnostic test.

7. Development Process & Documentation:

Phased Approach: Begin with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on a limited scope (e.g., 1-2 grade levels, core subjects, basic adaptive logic, essential reporting) to validate the core concept and assessment accuracy. Iterate based on feedback.

Documentation: Maintain the following documentation files (content to be generated/updated by the AI based on this prompt and subsequent refinements):
