Well, I am trying to build a product to bring out a school students understanding levels at particular grades. Basically I want to measure if a person is studying in grade 3 whether he is under able to understand the concepts of grade 3 that are being taught both in English language in science and mathematics or is he still stuck at their level one understanding ability or is that the student has the enough understanding ability of the language and the instructions rolled by the teacher but the teacher is not efficiently demonstrating her teaching capability or is it the student has to work on his memory to improve his performance in the class.
Basically my idea is that I want to understand why a person is not able to perform in the class and how to identify those skills that have to be improved in the student so that he can perform better in the class and bring or inculcate interest with respect to studies so that the student starts working on his own rather than depending on tuitions or remedial classes to make him perform better in his exams.

Now keeping this problem in the context let me know what skills I have to test in the student and how to scale or rate them to bring out logical conclusions to help him perform better in his exams at school level. For your information this product I want to build for grades starting from grade one to grade 12 so keep this in mind and give me suggestions how to test what to test and what kind of ratings or what kind of contextual outcomes I have to give or what kind of reports that I have to generate so that teachers get information about the learning outcomes of the student.

Also give me a sample question papers of at least 50 questions with all the suggestions that you give for at least two grades of grade 5 and grade 8 to be precise and also give me a sample report how it should look like and what kind of graph and metrics that I have to use to show the measurable outcome
