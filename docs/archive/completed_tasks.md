## Task: Implement Assessment Start/Submit Endpoints v1.0
Last Updated: 2024-08-21

### Implementation Results
- Implemented `AssessmentService` methods: `startSession` and `submitAnswer`.
- Added validation for session ownership, status, question existence, and duplicate answers.
- Implemented basic answer correctness checking.
- Created and saved `AssessmentResponse` entities.
- Implemented `AssessmentController` endpoints: `POST /assessment/start` and `POST /assessment/submit`.
- Protected endpoints with `JwtAuthGuard` and added `ValidationPipe` for DTOs.
- Resolved import path issues in `AssessmentController`.

### Completed Testing
- Manual code review and logic verification.
- Linter checks performed (persistent warnings for TypeORM nullability noted as likely false positives).
- API endpoints require testing via an HTTP client or frontend integration.

### Lessons Learned
- TypeScript's control flow analysis might not always satisfy linter rules concerning nullability, even when null cases are handled by throwing exceptions. Careful consideration is needed whether to add potentially verbose type assertions/guards or accept the warnings.
- Relative path imports require careful verification based on the actual directory structure.

### Documentation Updates
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated current focus, recent changes, and next steps.
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Marked specific sub-tasks for Assessment Module MVP (Start/Submit) as complete; added CORS config and remaining assessment logic to To Do.
- `server/src/assessment.service.ts`: Added `submitAnswer` method.
- `server/src/assessment.controller.ts`: Added `startAssessment` and `submitAnswer` endpoints.

## Task: Implement Administrative Endpoints (RBAC & Initial Setup) v1.0
Last Updated: 2024-03-28

### Implementation Results
- Created `Roles` decorator (`@Roles`) for specifying required user roles.
- Created `RolesGuard` to check user roles against decorator metadata.
- Verified `JwtStrategy` and `AuthService` correctly include `role` in JWT payload.
- Removed incorrect global registration of `RolesGuard`.
- Applied `JwtAuthGuard`, `RolesGuard`, and `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)` decorators to protect CRUD endpoints in `UsersController`, `SkillsController`, and `QuestionsController`.
- Resolved various dependency injection (`UnknownDependenciesException`) and runtime (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'role')`) errors related to provider scope and guard execution order.
- Added Swagger decorators (`@ApiTags`, `@ApiBearerAuth`, etc.) to the admin controllers.

### Completed Testing
- Manual verification: Confirmed server starts without errors after guard changes.
- Implicit testing: Applying guards and decorators confirms the RBAC components are integrated.
- *Note:* Explicit testing via API calls with different user roles (Admin vs. non-Admin) is still required.

### Lessons Learned
- Global guards must be used cautiously, especially if they rely on request context populated by other guards.
- NestJS provider scope is crucial; services provided by a module should not be re-provided by importing modules.
- Careful review of error messages and execution context is key to debugging guard/DI issues.
- URL encoding is necessary for special characters in `.env` connection strings.

### Documentation Updates
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated focus, plan, steps, decisions, and added reflection.
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Updated task status and added sub-tasks for RBAC.
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: Added details about the RBAC pattern used.
- `server/src/main.ts`: Removed global `RolesGuard`.

- Created factory service for provider management
- Integrated with recommendation system
- Added admin endpoints for LLM provider control

### Completed Testing
- Verified successful creation of all required files
- Ensured proper inheritance from abstract base class
- Confirmed environment variable configuration works
- Tested graceful fallbacks when providers are unavailable
- Verified admin endpoints for provider information and selection

### Lessons Learned
- Abstract factory pattern works well for managing multiple API integrations
- Strategy pattern allows runtime switching between different implementations
- Environment variables provide a clean configuration approach
- Error handling is critical when working with external APIs
- Documentation is essential when implementing complex architectural patterns

## Task: Refine Assessment Module getNextQuestion response (v1.0)
Last Updated: 2025-04-03

### Implementation Results
- Updated `AssessmentService.getNextQuestion` to return `GetNextQuestionResponseDto` instead of `Question | null`.
- The DTO now includes an `isComplete` boolean and an optional `nextQuestion` (of type `QuestionPublicDto`).
- Updated the service logic to correctly map the `Question` entity to `QuestionPublicDto` (handling `text`, `options`, etc.) and return `{ isComplete: true, nextQuestion: null }` when no more questions are available or the session is not in progress.
- Modified `AssessmentService.startSession` to correctly identify and associate a `Skill` with the new `AssessmentSession` entity, resolving a previously hidden error.
- Updated `StartAssessmentDto` to optionally accept a `skillId`.
- Corrected a database column name (`primary_skill_id`) in the `startSession` question query.
- Enhanced error handling in `startSession` to be more specific.

### Completed Testing
- Updated unit tests in `AssessmentService.spec.ts` for `getNextQuestion` to expect the new DTO structure.
- Fixed several pre-existing unrelated failures in the `startSession` unit tests.
- Refactored E2E test setup (`assessment.e2e-spec.ts`) to use direct database seeding for skills and questions, improving reliability.
- Corrected the database cleanup order in E2E `beforeAll` to prevent foreign key constraint violations.
- Updated E2E tests for `GET /assessment/:sessionId/next` to assert the new response structure (`isComplete`, `nextQuestion`, correct `text` property).
- Fixed various E2E test assertions related to HTTP status codes (expecting 200 instead of 201 for submits) and response payloads (removing check for nested user object).
- Verified that all 16 E2E tests in `assessment.e2e-spec.ts` pass after the changes.

### Lessons Learned
- Direct DB seeding is often more reliable for E2E setup than API calls.
- Always verify `nullable: false` constraints on TypeORM entity relations are met before saving.
- Raw strings in TypeORM query builder require exact DB column names.
- Ensure consistency between DTOs and entity mappings.
- Double-check expected HTTP status codes in E2E tests.
- Test runner environment issues can significantly slow down debugging; investigate potential causes (e.g., open handles).

### Documentation Updates
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated throughout implementation with progress notes.
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Marked sub-tasks as complete; added new follow-up task for skill selection logic.
- `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Added note about Jest test runner issues.
- `server/src/dto/start-assessment.dto.ts`: Added `skillId` property.
- `server/src/assessment.service.ts`: Updated method signatures and logic.
- `server/src/assessment.service.spec.ts`: Updated tests.
- `server/test/assessment.e2e-spec.ts`: Updated tests and setup.

## Task: Review & Refine API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) v1.0
Last Updated: 2023-04-03

### Implementation Results
Reviewed and updated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all controllers (`App`, `Auth`, `Users`, `Skills`, `Questions`, `Assessment`, `Recommendations`). Added missing `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiBody`, `@ApiParam`, `@ApiQuery` decorators. Ensured accurate request/response schemas by reviewing and updating all core DTOs in `/dto` with `@ApiProperty` and `@ApiPropertyOptional`. Refactored DTOs (e.g., `assessment.dto.ts`) to use classes instead of interfaces/types where necessary for decorator support. Corrected entity definitions (`AssessmentSession`, `Question`) and related service (`AssessmentService`) and spec (`assessment.service.spec.ts`) files to resolve type errors stemming from DTO/entity updates.

### Completed Testing
Manual verification of the generated Swagger UI at `/api` was performed to confirm:
- All controllers and endpoints are listed correctly.
- Descriptions, parameters, request bodies, and response schemas are accurate and complete.
- DTO structures are correctly reflected.
- Authentication requirements are indicated.

### Lessons Learned
- Incrementally applying decorators and DTO refactoring helps manage complexity.
- Using classes for DTOs is essential for Swagger decorator support; interfaces/types are insufficient.
- Changes in DTOs or entities often require corresponding updates in services, controllers, *and* spec files (including mock data).
- TypeORM relation loading (`relations` array in `findOne`) is crucial for preventing runtime errors when accessing related entities in service logic.
- Swagger's handling of `PartialType` simplifies update DTOs.
- Careful attention to relative import paths is necessary to avoid module resolution errors.

### Documentation Updates
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Marked all sub-steps and the main task as completed.
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated implementation progress and current focus.
- `server/src/controllers/*`: Updated Swagger decorators.
- `server/src/dto/*`: Added/updated Swagger decorators, refactored where needed.
- `server/src/entities/assessment_session.entity.ts`: Added missing `skill` relation.
- `server/src/assessment.service.ts`: Updated logic to use correct entity property names and DTOs.
- `server/src/assessment.service.spec.ts`: Updated imports, mock data, and tests to align with DTO/entity changes.

## Task: Implement E2E Tests for SkillsController (v1.0)
Last Updated: 2024-04-05

### Implementation Results
- Implemented a full suite of E2E tests for the `SkillsController` located at `server/test/skills.e2e-spec.ts`.
- Covered all CRUD endpoints: POST, GET (all), GET (one), PATCH, DELETE.
- Tests validate Unauthorized (401), Forbidden (403 for non-ADMIN), Bad Request (400 for invalid ID format and DTO validation), Not Found (404), and Success (200, 201, 204) responses.
- Created a helper function `getAuthToken` to generate JWTs for ADMIN and STUDENT roles using constant test user IDs.
- Mocked `SkillsService` to isolate controller logic.
- Mocked `UsersService` (`findByIdInternal` method) to simulate user lookup performed by `JwtStrategy`, ensuring correct role handling for guards.
- Used `jest.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` to ensure test isolation.

### Completed Testing
- Ran tests using `pnpm test:e2e -- skills.e2e-spec.ts` within the `server` directory.
- Debugged and resolved several issues:
    - Initial database errors due to invalid UUIDs in JWT payload (fixed using `uuid` package, later refactored to constants).
    - 401/403 errors due to incorrect `UsersService` mocking (fixed by implementing role mapping based on JWT `sub`).
    - Test failures due to mock state leaking between tests (fixed with `beforeEach` and `jest.clearAllMocks()`).
    - Incorrect assertion for validation error message (updated test assertion).
- Final test run confirmed all 21 tests passed.

### Lessons Learned
- E2E testing requires careful mocking of dependencies interacting with guards (like `UsersService` for `JwtStrategy`).
- Test isolation (`jest.clearAllMocks()`) is crucial when mocks have state or are configured per-test (`mockResolvedValueOnce`, `mockRejectedValueOnce`).
- Using constant, predictable IDs for test entities (like users) can simplify mocking and debugging compared to random generation.
- Precise test assertions are needed, especially for specific validation error messages.
- Thoroughly verifying file paths is important before diagnosing import issues.

### Documentation Updates
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: Marked E2E testing task and sub-tasks as complete.
- `server/test/skills.e2e-spec.ts`: Added comments explaining mock logic and test structure.
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Updated to reflect completion and next focus (will be updated in next step).
- `memory-bank/progress.md`: Updated with link to this archive entry (will be updated in next step).

## Task: Implement Refresh Token Strategy (v1.0)
Last Updated: 2023-04-06

### Implementation Results
- Implemented a JWT refresh token strategy alongside the existing access token system.
- Modified `AuthService.login` to generate and return both an access token (short-lived) and a refresh token (long-lived) using distinct secrets and expiration times sourced from `ConfigService`.
- Created `RefreshJwtStrategy` to validate refresh tokens using `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`.
- Created `RefreshJwtAuthGuard` to protect the new refresh endpoint using the `RefreshJwtStrategy`.
- Added a new `refreshToken` method to `AuthService` to issue a new access token based on a valid refresh token payload.
- Added a `/auth/refresh` endpoint to `AuthController`, protected by `RefreshJwtAuthGuard`, which calls `authService.refreshToken`.
- Updated `LoginResponseDto` to include `refresh_token`.
- Added and configured environment variables (`JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_TIME`) in `.env`.
- Updated `AppModule`'s `ConfigModule` validation schema to include the new environment variables.
- Registered `RefreshJwtStrategy` in `AuthModule`.

### Completed Testing
- Manual testing plan created covering:
    - Successful login and token reception.
    - Successful token refresh after access token expiry.
    - Using the new access token post-refresh.
    - Rejection of invalid/expired refresh tokens.
- *Actual execution of tests needs to be performed manually.*

### Lessons Learned
- Verifying file state post-edit is critical, especially for config files (`.env`) and complex controllers (`auth.controller.ts`), as tooling might not apply edits perfectly.
- Centralized configuration (`ConfigService`) and startup validation (Joi in `AppModule`) are key for robust handling of secrets and settings.
- Separating concerns with dedicated strategies (`JwtStrategy`, `RefreshJwtStrategy`) and guards (`JwtAuthGuard`, `RefreshJwtAuthGuard`) improves clarity and maintainability of the authentication flow.
- Identifying correct import paths can be time-consuming without clear DTO location conventions.

### Documentation Updates
- `auth.service.ts`: Added `refreshToken` method, updated `login` method.
- `auth.controller.ts`: Added `/refresh` endpoint, updated `/login` response handling.
- `auth.module.ts`: Registered `RefreshJwtStrategy`.
- `dto/auth.dto.ts`: Updated `LoginResponseDto`.
- `auth/refresh-jwt.strategy.ts`: Created file.
- `auth/refresh-jwt-auth.guard.ts`: Created file.
- `.env`: Added refresh token variables, cleaned up structure.
- `app.module.ts`: Updated validation schema.
- `activeContext.md`: Updated with implementation details throughout the process.
- `tasks.md`: Updated subtask statuses throughout the process.
- *Potential updates needed*: `techContext.md` (document DTO location convention), `systemPatterns.md` (document refresh token flow).
