# Hybrid Response Function Fix

## Issue
When using the `createHybridResponse` function, it was incorrectly being called with an object `{ correct: boolean }` as the third parameter when it expected a boolean directly. This was causing TypeScript errors:

```
Argument of type '{ correct: boolean; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.
```

## Root Cause
The `createHybridResponse` function has a parameter signature:
```typescript
function createHybridResponse<T>(
  data: T | null, 
  message: string = '', 
  successOrProps: boolean | Record<string, any> = true
): any
```

When the third parameter is a boolean, it sets the `success` property without adding extra properties. When an object is passed, it spreads all properties from that object into the response.

The problematic pattern was:
```typescript
createHybridResponse(
  result,
  message,
  { correct: result.isCorrect } // Incorrect: adds an unwanted 'correct' property
);
```

## Solution
The fix was to pass the boolean value directly:
```typescript
createHybridResponse(
  result,
  message,
  result.isCorrect // Correct: sets success without adding extra properties
);
```

## Impact
- Tests no longer fail due to unexpected properties
- Responses have a cleaner structure without duplicated information
- TypeScript errors are resolved

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Added JSDoc comments to clarify function usage
2. Updated tests to verify correct function behavior
3. Created examples showing correct and incorrect usage
