- **Documentation:** Refresh token flow needs documentation in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **RecommendationsService Enhancements:** (See backlog in tasks.md)
- **AssessmentService Enhancements:** (See backlog in tasks.md)

## Next Steps
- Complete unit and E2E tests for Auth module.
- Address backlog items (DTO refactor, documentation).
- Plan next major development phase (e.g., Deployment, Frontend Integration).
## Current Status: Project Initialization

*   **Overall:** The project is in the initial setup and planning phase.
*   **Documentation:** Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content based on the project description.
*   **Architecture:** High-level architecture and potential technology stack have been outlined.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- Authentication system with JWT
- User registration and login
- Assessment session creation and management
- Question retrieval and answer submission
- Skill scoring and assessment results

### Infrastructure
- NestJS server with TypeORM
- PostgreSQL database with proper entity relationships
- End-to-end testing framework with Jest
- Swagger API documentation

### Recent Implementations
- **API Response Standardization**: Implemented a consistent response format across all endpoints to improve client experience and error handling
- API documentation for the standardized response format
- Global exception handling with consistent error responses

## What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   Everything! Including:
    *   Detailed MVP definition.
    *   Frontend applications (Mobile & Web).
    *   Backend API and services (Auth, Assessment, Reporting, E-learning, CMS).
    *   Database schema design and implementation.
    *   Question Bank population and validation process.
    *   E-learning course content creation.
    *   Adaptive testing algorithm implementation.
    *   Reporting engine implementation.
    *   Deployment infrastructure setup.
    *   Testing framework setup (Unit, Integration, E2E).

## Known Issues / Challenges

*   **Content Bottleneck:** Building the high-quality, validated question bank and course content will be the most significant effort and potential bottleneck.
*   **Psychometric Validity:** Ensuring the assessment is accurate and reliable requires specialized expertise and rigorous validation.
*   **Technical Complexity:** Integrating all modules (adaptive testing, reporting, e-learning) into a seamless platform is complex.

## Implemented Features

- User Authentication System (JWT-based)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Assessment Engine
- Recommendation System
- Database Schema & Entity Models
- Rule-Based Recommendation Engine
- AI-Powered Recommendation System with Multiple LLM Providers:
  - Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (default)
  - OpenAI GPT models
  - Anthropic Claude
  - Cohere
  - Factory pattern for provider management
  - Admin controls for provider selection
- LLM Response Caching System:
  - In-memory cache with TTL expiration
  - LRU eviction policy for cache size management
  - Admin endpoints for cache statistics and clearing
  - Transparent integration with all LLM providers
  - Performance metrics tracking (hits, misses, hit ratio)
  - Admin endpoints for metrics monitoring and reset

## In Progress

- Implementing Basic Unit/Integration Tests for core backend modules (Auth, CRUD, Assessment, Recommendations).

## Planned Work

- Dashboard for tracking recommendation effectiveness
- Expanding LLM capabilities to other parts of the application
- Integration with vector databases for better semantic matching
- Reviewing and refining API documentation.

## Technical Debt

- Add unit tests for LLM providers
- Implement error tracking for LLM API calls
- Create proper documentation for API endpoints
- Optimize database queries for recommendation generation

## LLM Caching System

We've implemented a comprehensive caching system for LLM responses:

### In-Memory Cache ✓
- Implemented Map-based in-memory cache with TTL expiration
- Added cache metrics tracking (hits, misses, hit ratio)
- Configured via environment variables
- Added admin endpoints for viewing and managing cache

### Redis Cache ✓
- Added Redis-based persistent cache implementation
- Implemented fallback to in-memory cache when Redis is unavailable
- Created common interface for cache providers
- Added type-safe configuration for Redis store
- Fixed dependency injection and type compatibility issues
- Made methods consistently async for proper Promise handling

### Cache Optimization ✓
- Implemented prompt normalization for increased hit rates
- Added prompt truncation for very long prompts
- Created model-based cache invalidation
- Added provider-specific cache clearing
- Improved cache key generation with standardization

### Admin Endpoints ✓
- GET /recommendations/llm/cache/stats - View cache statistics
- POST /recommendations/llm/cache/clear - Clear the cache
- POST /recommendations/llm/cache/reset-metrics - Reset metrics counters
- POST /recommendations/llm/config - Update provider config with auto-cache invalidation

### Documentation ✓
- Added Redis setup instructions to techContext.md
- Updated .env.example with Redis configuration
- Added configuration options to memory bank
- Updated system patterns documentation with caching architecture
- Documented prompt normalization and cache invalidation strategies

### Next Steps
- Add unit tests for the caching system
- Consider implementing RedisSearch for more granular Redis cache control
- Explore response compression for larger cached items

## Known Issues
- Initial E2E tests might be flaky depending on database state.
- HMR implementation was complex; switched to `tsc-watch`.
- Manual testing required for refresh token flow.
- DTO location convention needs formalization.

## Future Considerations
- Optimize LLM caching further (e.g., prompt similarity matching).
- Implement Redis Sentinel or Cluster for high availability.
- Consider implementing RedisSearch for more granular Redis cache control.
- Explore response compression for larger cached items.

## In Progress Features

- **Skill Management:** CRUD operations for skills (SkillsService, SkillsController).
- **Question Management:** CRUD operations for questions, including skill association (QuestionsService, QuestionsController).
- **Assessment Logic:** Core assessment session flow including starting sessions, submitting answers, calculating scores (basic Elo-like), and getting the next question (AssessmentService, AssessmentController).
- **Recommendation Engine:** Generation of recommendations based on skill gaps, including standard resource lookup and AI-powered recommendation generation (RecommendationsService, RecommendationsController).
- **AI Integration:** Basic integration with `AiRecommendationService` for generating personalized recommendations and explanations.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger documentation added for all controllers and DTOs.
- **Unit Testing:** Unit tests created for `UsersService`, `SkillsService`, and `QuestionsService`.

### Current Status
- Core API implementation is complete.
- Unit test coverage exists for key services.
- Code review and initial refactoring are complete.

- Ready to proceed with deployment preparation.

### What's Left to Build/Test
- **Deployment Setup:** Docker configuration, environment variables, potential CI/CD pipeline.
- **Further Testing:** Expand integration/E2E test coverage based on deployment needs or identified gaps.
- **Frontend Integration:** (Out of scope for current backend focus)

### Known Issues/TODOs
- **RecommendationsService:** 
    - Enhance standard resource selection (currently takes first of 3).
    - Implement AI resource lifecycle management (check duplicates).
    - Implement logic to avoid recommending recently completed/seen resources.
    - Refine `overallProgress` and `summary` calculation logic.
- **AssessmentService:**
    - Review and potentially optimize skill selection logic in `startSession`.
    - Improve question randomization performance if needed.
    - Enhance error handling in `getNextQuestion` if next question isn't found.
    - Consider refining the scoring model (`_updateSkillScore`).
- **General:** Add more comprehensive unit/integration test coverage.
