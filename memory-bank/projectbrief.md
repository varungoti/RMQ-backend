# Project Brief: Learner Insights

## 1. Project Goal

To develop an adaptive diagnostic testing and integrated e-learning platform ("Learner Insights") for students in Grades 1-12. The platform aims to identify not just *if* a student is struggling academically, but *why*, by assessing both grade-specific knowledge and foundational cognitive skills. It will provide detailed, visual diagnostic reports and offer targeted micro-courses to address identified weaknesses.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **Adaptive Diagnostic Testing:** Assess students across English, Mathematics, Science, and foundational cognitive skills (Language Processing, Working Memory, Logical Reasoning, Attention, Processing Speed) using an adaptive algorithm.
*   **Comprehensive Question Bank:** Create a large, meticulously tagged question bank covering all relevant grades, subjects, and skills, with varying difficulty levels. AI assistance can be used for drafting, but human expert validation is mandatory.
*   **Detailed Visual Reporting:** Generate insightful, visually rich reports (leveraging concepts from `MultiPageReportBuilder`) that detail performance levels (e.g., Significantly Below, Approaching, Meeting, Exceeding Expectations) across all assessed areas, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and potential root causes.
*   **Integrated E-Learning Module:** Offer a catalog of targeted, engaging micro-courses directly linked to the skills identified as needing improvement in the diagnostic report.
*   **User Roles & Portals:** Support distinct roles for Students, Parents, and Teachers/Schools, with appropriate dashboards and data views.
*   **B2B Focus:** Primarily target schools and educational institutions as customers, offering platform access on a license basis.
*   **Optional B2C Upsell:** Allow students/parents to purchase individual micro-courses directly.

## 3. Key Features

*   Secure User Registration and Management
*   Adaptive Testing Engine
*   Tagged Question Bank Database
*   Reporting & Analytics Engine
*   Interactive In-App Report Display (with PDF export)
*   Recommendation Engine (linking skills to courses/tips)
*   E-Learning Course Catalog & Player (video, quizzes, exercises)
*   Parent/Teacher Portal (B2B feature)
*   Admin Panel for Content & User Management

## 4. Non-Goals (Initially)

*   Real-time tutoring features.
*   Direct social interaction features between students.
*   Full LMS integration (beyond basic data export/import, maybe considered later).
*   Support for subjects beyond English, Math, Science initially.
