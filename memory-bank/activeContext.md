# Active Context: Learner Insights

## Current Focus: Backend Development - Implementing Auth Module Tests
*Goal: Complete comprehensive unit and E2E tests for the AuthModule, covering login, registration, token validation, and refresh token flow.*

**Deployment Update:**
- The project now uses Supabase as the managed Postgres database for all environments. All deployment and environment documentation has been updated to reflect this. See `docs/deployment.md` for details.

## Project Goals
[Brief overview of project goals]

## Recent Completions
- Fixed test assertion inconsistency in assessment-standalone.e2e-spec.ts: Corrected a comment that incorrectly stated a property should be included when the test was actually verifying it should NOT be included.
- Implemented tests for auth.service.spec.ts: Successfully added test cases for validateUser, login, register, and refreshToken methods with proper mocking of dependencies (JwtService, UsersService, ConfigService).
- Fixed import errors in AssessmentController: Resolved missing module imports for '../dto/skill-score.dto', '../auth/get-user.decorator', and '../auth/assessment-owner.guard' that were causing linter errors and test failures. All E2E tests now pass successfully.

- Completed Swagger documentation refinement for `RecommendationsController`. Added/updated `ApiOperation`, `ApiResponse`, `ApiBody`, `ApiParam`, `ApiQuery` decorators. Defined and integrated DTOs for request/response types and applied ValidationPipe where appropriate. Removed redundant inline interfaces.
- Reviewed all core DTOs in `server/src/dto/`. Added missing `@ApiProperty`/`@ApiPropertyOptional` decorators to ensure complete Swagger schema generation. Refactored `assessment.dto.ts` to use classes instead of interfaces/types.
- Fixed entity definitions (`AssessmentSession`, `Question`) and updated related service logic (`AssessmentService`) and spec file (`assessment.service.spec.ts`) to resolve linter errors introduced during DTO refactoring.
- Applying RBAC to endpoints in `UsersController`.
- Applying RBAC to endpoints in `SkillsController`.

## New Implementation Progress

- Created a new LlmCacheService that provides in-memory caching for LLM responses
- Updated the abstract LlmProviderService to support caching through a new sendPromptWithCache method
- Updated the LlmFactoryService to inject the cache service into all providers
- Updated the AI recommendation service to use the cached version of prompts
- Added admin endpoints to view cache statistics and clear the cache
- Updated the environment configuration with cache-related settings
- Added detailed cache metrics tracking:
  - Cache hits and misses
  - Hit ratio calculation
  - Eviction and expiration tracking
  - Endpoint to view metrics
  - Endpoint to reset metrics
- Implemented Redis-based persistent caching system:
  - Installed Redis cache dependencies
  - Created LlmRedisCacheService for Redis integration
  - Added fallback to in-memory cache when Redis is unavailable
  - Created ILlmCacheService interface for consistent API
  - Updated factory to support switching between cache implementations
  - Added Redis-specific configuration options to environment

## New Key Features of the LLM Cache

1. **In-Memory Cache**: Uses a Map for fast lookup and retrieval
2. **TTL-Based Expiration**: Cached responses expire after a configurable time
3. **LRU Eviction Policy**: When cache reaches maximum size, the oldest entries are removed
4. **Configurable**: Cache can be enabled/disabled and configured via environment variables
5. **Admin Controls**: Endpoints for viewing stats and clearing the cache
6. **Transparent Integration**: Works automatically with existing providers
7. **Redis Persistence**: Optional persistent caching with Redis
8. **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to in-memory cache when Redis is unavailable
9. **Graceful Degradation**: Works without Redis in development environments

## New Environment Configuration

```
# LLM Caching
LLM_CACHE_ENABLED=true # Enable/disable the in-memory cache
LLM_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=3600 # Cache expiration time (1 hour)
LLM_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=1000 # Maximum number of cached entries

# Redis Caching
REDIS_CACHE_ENABLED=true # Enable/disable Redis cache
REDIS_HOST=localhost # Redis host
REDIS_PORT=6379 # Redis port
REDIS_PASSWORD= # Redis password (optional)
REDIS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=86400 # Redis cache expiration (24 hours)
REDIS_CACHE_MAX_ITEMS=10000 # Maximum number of Redis cached entries
```

## Challenges Resolved

- Fixed TypeScript type errors between cache implementations by creating a common interface
- Implemented proper Promise handling for async Redis operations
- Created fallback mechanism to ensure system works even when Redis is unavailable
- Resolved module import issues and circular dependencies
- Successfully integrated with the existing LLM factory system
- Fixed TypeScript error in Redis cache module by using proper type definitions and making the useFactory return type compatible with NestJS expectations
- Resolved dependency injection error by adding LlmCacheService to the providers of LlmRedisCacheModule
- Fixed type compatibility issues between Redis cache stats and controller expectations by transforming the return type
- Made methods consistently async across the caching system to support Redis operations
- Fixed entity creation in the seed utility by correctly mapping entity structures and using appropriate enums
- Addressed potential TypeORM connection issues in the Docker setup by properly configuring SSL for production
- Ensured proper container orchestration with health checks and dependency management
- Provided clear documentation for deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting processes

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Confirming JWT secret key strategy (environment variable is standard).
*   Adding HMR will improve development speed by avoiding full server restarts.
*   Using NestJS standard RBAC approach with decorators and guards for admin permissions.
*   Defining payload for JWT.
*   Error handling strategy for authentication failures.
*   Logging levels and formats.
*   Decide on fields for `CreateQuestionDto` (text, type, options, answer, difficulty, skill association).
*   How to handle question options (e.g., JSONB array?).
*   How to select questions for an assessment session (MVP: maybe fixed set, or simple random based on grade/skill?).
*   How/when to calculate skill scores (real-time vs end-of-session?).
*   Structure of data returned when fetching questions for a session.
*   The core MVP backend API (Auth, Skills CRUD, Questions CRUD, Assessment Start/Submit) is largely complete.
*   Linter warnings persist in `AssessmentService` related to TypeORM `findOne`/`findOneBy` nullability, treated as false positives for now.
*   Decided to store ordered `questionIds` as `simple-array` on `AssessmentSession` for fetching next question.
*   Deferred more complex assessment logic (detailed scoring, overall result calculation) for post-MVP.
*   Frontend development can now begin integrating with the completed backend endpoints.
*   How to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)? (e.g., extending `JwtAuthGuard`, using NestJS built-in RBAC features).
*   What specific actions should Admins be allowed for each entity (Full CRUD, specific status changes?).
*   Should we introduce a separate `AdminModule` or integrate endpoints into existing modules (`Users`, `Skills`, `Questions`)?
*   Manual testing of the refresh token flow is required.
*   A decision on DTO location convention is pending.
*   The need for automated tests for the authentication module should be prioritized.

## Previous Focus: Project Initialization & Planning

*   Setting up the initial project structure and documentation (Memory Bank).
*   Defining the core architecture and technology stack.
*   Detailing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features and scope.
*   Outlining the development phases and content strategy (Question Bank & Courses).

## Previous Changes

*   Cloned the `cursor-memory-bank` template structure (though files needed manual creation).
*   Created the `memory-bank/` directory.
*   Populated `projectbrief.md` with core goals and requirements.
*   Populated `productContext.md` with the problem space, audience, and value proposition.

## Previous Next Steps

1.  ~~Create `systemPatterns.md` (high-level architecture).~~
2.  ~~Create `techContext.md` (initial technology stack choices).~~
3.  ~~Create `progress.md` (initial state).~~
4.  ~~Define the MVP scope in more detail.~~
5.  **Set up Project Repository:** Initialize using a suitable Next.js admin starter kit.
6.  **Database Schema Design:** Detail tables for Users, Questions, Results (for MVP scope).
7.  **Backend API Setup:** Initialize Node.js/NestJS project, basic configs.
8.  **Content Team Kickoff:** Engage SMEs for Grade 5 Math content validation.

## Previous Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Confirming the primary technology stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) - *Decision: Stack defined in techContext.md is adopted.*
*   ~~Deciding on the initial scope for the MVP (e.g., specific grade band and subject).~~ - *Decision: MVP scope set to Grade 5 Mathematics + relevant Cognitive Skills (Logical Reasoning, Working Memory).*
*   Planning the resource allocation for content creation (SMEs, instructional designers) - *Action: Initiate recruitment/engagement for Grade 5 Math SMEs.*

## REFLECTION

### What Went Well
- Successfully identified and resolved the `UnknownDependenciesException` by correcting the providers in `AppModule`.
- Correctly identified the cause of the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'role')` error (global `RolesGuard`) and resolved it by removing the global registration.
- The existing `UserRole` enum, `JwtStrategy`, and `AuthService` payload logic already supported roles, simplifying the RBAC setup.
- Applying the `JwtAuthGuard`, `RolesGuard`, and `@Roles` decorator pattern to controllers was straightforward.
- Successfully corrected import path errors in `SkillsController`.

### Challenges
- Initial error with `DATABASE_URL` required debugging the `.env` file format (URL encoding).
- Encountered the `UnknownDependenciesException` due to misunderstanding NestJS provider scope between modules.
- The global `RolesGuard` caused an unexpected runtime error by executing on unauthenticated routes.
- Persistent issues with the `edit_file` tool corrupting `tasks.md`, requiring manual tracking or retries.

### Lessons Learned
- Double-check URL encoding for special characters in connection strings within `.env` files.
- Providers in NestJS are scoped to their module; avoid declaring them again in importing modules unless explicitly needed.
- Global guards run on *all* routes; apply guards selectively if they depend on prior guards (like `JwtAuthGuard`).
- File editing tools can be unreliable; re-verify changes or use alternative methods if issues persist.
- Always verify the full execution context when debugging guard errors (e.g., is `request.user` actually populated?).

### Improvements for Next Time
- Apply guards more selectively from the start instead of defaulting to global registration, especially if they have dependencies.
- Be more cautious when editing files, potentially breaking down complex edits into smaller steps to mitigate tool errors.
- Add basic integration tests earlier for guards and protected endpoints to catch context issues sooner.
- Document guard dependencies (e.g., `RolesGuard` requires `JwtAuthGuard` to run first) more explicitly in code comments or documentation.

*   **AssessmentService Unit Tests:**
    *   `startSession`: COMPLETED (Handles session creation, user not found, insufficient questions).
    *   `submitAnswer`: COMPLETED (Handles correct/incorrect answers, session completion, invalid input).
    *   `getNextQuestion`: COMPLETED (Handles returning next question, first question, completion, session ownership).
*   **AssessmentController E2E Tests:**
    *   `POST /assessment/start`: COMPLETED (Handles auth, validation, successful start).
    *   `POST /assessment/submit`: COMPLETED (Handles auth, validation, correct/incorrect, duplicates, completed sessions).
    *   `GET /assessment/:sessionId/next`: COMPLETED (Handles auth, session state, completion, ownership).

### Current Focus

- Continue refining Assessment Module (e.g., scoring logic, session management) or review API documentation.

## Current Work Focus
- Completed the initial pass of **Integration Testing**.
- Implemented tests for Auth, Assessment, Recommendation, and Admin CRUD flows.
- Assumed tests are passing (pending confirmation from user).
- Next step is to begin **Phase 9: Deployment Preparation**.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Created integration test files: `auth.integration-spec.ts`, `assessment.integration-spec.ts`, `recommendations.integration-spec.ts`, `admin-crud.integration-spec.ts`.
- Implemented setup (`beforeAll`) and cleanup (`afterAll`) logic using database interactions.
- Used Jest and Supertest to simulate API calls and assert responses.
- Covered key positive and negative paths, including authorization checks.

## Next Steps
1.  **Start Deployment Preparation Phase:** 
    - Create `Dockerfile` for the server application.
    - Create `docker-compose.yml` for running the app and database.
    - Define and document necessary environment variables in `.env.example`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Confirm integration test results.
- Decide on base Docker image for the Node.js application.
- Determine required environment variables for production/staging (Database URL, JWT Secret, Ports, AI Service Keys if applicable).
- Await user confirmation on the next task to focus on (e.g., automated tests, frontend integration, new feature).

## New Implementation Progress

- Implement Automated Tests for Auth Module (Unit & E2E).

## Recent Changes
- Completed 'Implement Refresh Token Strategy' task.
- Archived refresh token task.
- Initiated the 'Implement Automated Tests for Auth Module' task.
- Updated tasks.md with new task breakdown.

## Recent Completions
- Implement Refresh Token Strategy has been completed and archived. Next focus is on implementing automated tests for the Auth module.

## Next Steps
- Plan detailed test scenarios for Auth module.
- Setup testing environment and necessary mocks.
- Begin writing unit tests for `AuthService`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Determine mocking strategy for dependencies (`UsersService`, `JwtService`, `ConfigService`, `TypeORM Repository`).
- Decide on approach for handling database state in E2E tests (e.g., reset scripts, transactions, test database).
- Manual testing of the refresh token flow is still required until automated tests are complete.

## Current Work Focus

### API Standardization
- Implementing a consistent response format across all API endpoints
- Using `ClassSerializerInterceptor` to transform entity objects to DTOs
- Ensuring proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Updating end-to-end tests to accommodate the new response format

### Test Suite Improvements
- Addressing issues with end-to-end tests failing due to response format changes
- Investigating timeouts and hanging issues in the Jest test runner
- Expanding test coverage to ensure all endpoints follow the new format

## Recent Changes

### Response Wrapper Implementation
- Created a `ResponseWrapper` class to standardize all API responses
- Modified controller methods to use the wrapper format
- Updated DTO classes with appropriate serialization decorators
- Commented out certain interceptor usage to avoid double-transformation issues

### Test Failures
- Assessment submission tests failing due to response format changes
- Identified issues with property exposure in `AssessmentResponseDto`
- Working on updating tests to expect the new response structure

## Next Steps

1. Complete standardization of all controller endpoints
2. Update remaining end-to-end tests to match new response format
3. Review and fix any remaining serialization issues
4. Document the new API format in Swagger
5. Create examples for client integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Response Format Design
- Decision to use a consistent wrapper for all responses
- Consideration of performance impact from serialization/transformation
- Balance between simplicity and completeness of response data

### Testing Strategy
- Need to ensure tests validate both the response format and the actual data
- Consideration of test isolation vs. integration for faster feedback
- Addressing test environment issues with hanging processes

## Current Focus: API Documentation Refinement - Standardizing Response Formats
*Goal: Review and refine API documentation with Swagger, ensuring consistent response formats and clear usage guidelines for the hybrid response pattern.*

## API Documentation Refinement Plan

### Current State Analysis
- The project uses a hybrid response format during API transition
- We have two main response patterns:
  1. Direct DTO responses (legacy)
  2. `ResponseWrapper<T>` standardized format (newer)
- The `createHybridResponse` utility helps bridge these patterns
- Documentation exists (`docs/hybrid-response-usage-guide.md` and `docs/hybrid-response-fix.md`)
- Swagger documentation is implemented but needs consistency review

### Identified Issues in AuthController
- Missing hybrid response documentation - AuthController doesn't use LegacyResponseInterceptor
- Incomplete response examples - no detailed examples provided
- Missing API documentation decorators - no ApiExtraModels or ApiBearerAuth
- Inconsistency with other controllers - different response format approach

### Identified Issues in AssessmentController
- Inconsistent response format documentation between endpoints
- Response schemas don't always reflect the hybrid response structure
- Some direct properties aren't documented in the schema
- Inconsistent implementation between methods

### Identified Issues in SkillsController
- Missing hybrid response documentation - no LegacyResponseInterceptor used
- Return types use direct entity (Skill) without ResponseWrapper
- Response schemas don't document the hybrid format
- Special considerations needed for array responses (findAll method)

### Identified Issues in QuestionsController
- Missing hybrid response documentation - no LegacyResponseInterceptor used
- Return types use direct entity (Question) without ResponseWrapper
- No content examples for API responses
- Special consideration needed for the correctAnswer property which should not be exposed

### Identified Issues in UsersController
- Missing hybrid response documentation - no LegacyResponseInterceptor used
- Return types use direct entity (User) without ResponseWrapper
- No content examples for API responses
- Special handling needed for the passwordHash field which should never be exposed

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Review Controllers**:
   - ✓ Verify all controllers have proper `@ApiTags` and `@ApiBearerAuth` decorators
   - ✓ Ensure each endpoint has `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse` decorators
   - ✓ Standardize response examples showing both direct properties and wrapped format

2. **Enhance DTOs**:
   - ✓ Review all DTOs to ensure complete `@ApiProperty`/`@ApiPropertyOptional` coverage
   - ✓ Add descriptive examples to property decorators
   - ✓ Use consistent format for common properties (ids, dates, etc.)

3. **Document Hybrid Response Pattern**:
   - ✓ Update Swagger schemas to clearly show the hybrid format
   - ✓ Use `schema: { allOf: [...] }` pattern to show combined properties
   - ✓ Include clear examples of successful/error responses

4. **Add Test Coverage**:
   - ✓ Enhance existing tests to verify response format correctness
   - ✓ Add specific tests for response schema validation
    
### AssessmentController Review Summary
1. **Controller-level decorators** are well implemented with proper ApiTags, ApiBearerAuth, and ApiExtraModels
2. **Endpoint documentation** is detailed with ApiOperation, ApiResponse, ApiBody, and ApiParam decorators
3. **Response schemas** need improvement to properly document hybrid format
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Standardize schema documentation with consistent use of allOf
   - Update examples to show both direct and wrapped properties
   - Use consistent implementation approach (ResponseWrapper + interceptor)
   - Ensure property names in examples match actual response fields

### AuthController Review Summary
1. **Good basic documentation** with ApiTags, ApiOperation, and ApiResponse decorators
2. **Missing hybrid response support** - controller doesn't use LegacyResponseInterceptor
3. **Inconsistent response format** compared to other controllers
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Add controller-level ApiExtraModels and UseInterceptors(LegacyResponseInterceptor)
   - Update method return types to use ResponseWrapper
   - Enhance endpoint documentation with hybrid response schemas
   - Add detailed response examples for all status codes

### SkillsController Review Summary
1. **Controller setup** with ApiTags and ApiBearerAuth is well-implemented
2. **Endpoint documentation** has good basics with ApiOperation and ApiResponse
3. **Missing hybrid response support** similar to AuthController
4. **Special handling needed for array responses**
5. **Recommendations**:
   - Add controller-level decorators for LegacyResponseInterceptor and ApiExtraModels
   - Update all methods to return ResponseWrapper<T>
   - Properly document array responses with hybrid format consideration
   - Include comprehensive examples for all endpoints

### QuestionsController Review Summary
1. **Good basic API documentation** is in place with ApiTags, ApiBearerAuth, and role-based access control
2. **Missing hybrid response support** and documentation similar to other controllers
3. **Special handling needed for correctAnswer field** which should not be exposed
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Add controller-level decorators for LegacyResponseInterceptor and ApiExtraModels
   - Clearly document in descriptions that correctAnswer will not be included in responses
   - Exclude correctAnswer from response schema properties and examples
   - Update all methods to return ResponseWrapper<T>

### UsersController Review Summary
1. **Controller setup** with ApiTags and proper role-based access control is well implemented
2. **Endpoint documentation** has good basics with ApiOperation, ApiResponse, and ApiParam
3. **Missing hybrid response support** similar to other controllers
4. **Special handling needed for passwordHash field** which should never be exposed
5. **Recommendations**:
   - Add controller-level decorators for LegacyResponseInterceptor and ApiExtraModels
   - Use Omit<User, 'passwordHash'> type in return types to explicitly exclude sensitive data
   - Update all methods to return ResponseWrapper<T>
   - Document clearly that passwordHash is never included in responses

### Next Steps
1. ✓ Complete review of AssessmentController documentation
2. ✓ Complete review of AuthController documentation
3. ✓ Complete review of SkillsController documentation
4. ✓ Complete review of QuestionsController documentation
5. ✓ Complete review of UsersController documentation
6. Begin review of RecommendationsController documentation using the checklist
7. Apply documentation patterns to all controllers
8. Create implementation guide for standardizing controller responses

## Current Focus: Deployment Setup (Docker and Configuration)
*Goal: Complete the deployment setup for the RMQ system, including Docker configuration, database setup, and deployment documentation.*

## Recent Completions
- Fixed AssessmentController import errors: Resolved missing module imports for '../dto/skill-score.dto', '../auth/get-user.decorator', and '../auth/assessment-owner.guard' that were causing linter errors and test failures. All E2E tests now pass successfully.
- Deployment Setup: Enhanced the docker-compose.yml file to include PostgreSQL and Redis services, added database seed functionality, and created comprehensive deployment documentation.

## Implementation Progress

- Enhanced docker-compose.yml to include PostgreSQL database and Redis cache services with appropriate configuration.
- Added health checks to ensure services start in the correct order.
- Created a database seed utility (src/seed.ts) to initialize the database with essential data (admin user, sample skills).
- Added a 'db:seed' script to package.json for easy database initialization.
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation (docs/deployment.md) with detailed instructions for environment setup, deployment process, backups, and troubleshooting.
- Ensured all environment variables have sensible defaults while allowing customization.

## Challenges Resolved

- Fixed entity creation in the seed utility by correctly mapping entity structures and using appropriate enums.
- Addressed potential TypeORM connection issues in the Docker setup by properly configuring SSL for production.
- Ensured proper container orchestration with health checks and dependency management.
- Provided clear documentation for deployment, configuration, and troubleshooting processes.

## Recent Updates

### MessagingController Improvements
