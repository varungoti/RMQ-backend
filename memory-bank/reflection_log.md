## REFLECTION

### What Went Well
- Successfully identified the mechanism causing the potential 204/null response (service returning `null` when assessment is complete).
- Defined a clear, more informative response structure (`{ isComplete: boolean, nextQuestion: QuestionPublic | null }`) to improve client-side handling.
- Correctly updated the `AssessmentService` method (`getNextQuestion`) to return the new structure.
- Updated the `AssessmentController` method signature and Swagger `@ApiResponse` decorator accurately.
- Successfully updated the existing unit tests in `AssessmentService.spec.ts` to match the new return type and logic, including mocking `findOneOrFail` correctly.
- Updated the E2E tests in `assessment.e2e-spec.ts` to verify the new response structure in both completion scenarios (question available, assessment complete).
- Handled intermediate steps like creating the DTO file and fixing linter errors (import extension) smoothly.

### Challenges
- Initial confusion about whether the endpoint returned 204 or 200 with `null` body. Reading the controller code clarified it should be 200 OK with `null` by default, but the refinement still improves clarity.
- Required careful reading of existing unit and E2E tests to ensure updates covered all relevant scenarios and mock setups (e.g., using `findOneOrFail` vs `findOne`).
- Needed to create a new DTO file (`assessment.dto.ts`) as one didn't exist specifically for general assessment responses.

### Lessons Learned
- Returning explicit status flags (like `isComplete`) alongside potentially nullable data is often clearer for clients than relying on `null` alone.
- E2E tests are crucial for verifying controller-level behavior, including response structure and status codes, especially after service logic changes.
- Always verify the exact method used by TypeORM services (`findOne`, `findOneBy`, `findOneOrFail`) when writing or updating unit tests to ensure mocks are accurate.
- Keep DTOs organized; creating a general `assessment.dto.ts` was appropriate here.

### Improvements for Next Time
- When an unexpected response code (like 204) is reported, double-check the controller's `@HttpCode` decorator and return type handling early in the analysis.
- Create shared mock data setup functions within spec files (especially E2E) to reduce duplication when setting up prerequisites (like users, sessions, questions).
- Consider adding a specific `QuestionPublicDto` class with `@ApiProperty` decorators for more precise Swagger documentation of the omitted `correctAnswer` field, rather than just relying on the `Question` type in the `GetNextQuestionResponseDto`.
