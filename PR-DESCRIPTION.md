# Fix createHybridResponse function usage in assessment controller

## Problem

The `createHybridResponse` function was being incorrectly called with an object `{ correct: result.isCorrect }` as the third parameter, causing TypeScript errors:

```
Argument of type '{ correct: boolean; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'boolean'.
```

This also added an unwanted `correct` property to the response, which caused test failures.

## Solution

- Changed the function call to pass the boolean value directly: `result.isCorrect`
- Added clear comments explaining the correct usage pattern
- Created documentation to prevent future issues

## Changes

1. **Fixed Controller Code**:
   - Updated the `submitAnswer` method in `assessment.controller.ts`
   - Added comments explaining the correct usage

2. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created `hybrid-response-fix.md` explaining the issue and solution
   - Created `hybrid-response-usage-guide.md` with detailed usage instructions
   - Updated the README with usage guidelines

3. **Added Prevention Tools**:
   - Created tests to verify correct behavior
   - Added a custom ESLint rule to catch incorrect usage
   - Added static analysis scripts to detect issues
   - Added npm scripts for running the checks

## Testing

- Verified the fix using multiple test approaches
- Ran existing e2e tests to ensure they still pass
- Created specific verification tests for this function

## Additional Notes

This issue could potentially affect other parts of the codebase if the pattern has been copied. The added tooling will help identify any other instances of the same issue.
